## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that there is more than one way to set up grid and depending on the situation, one method may work better than another.  I found that the method I used for my last project didn't work so well for this one so I had to try a different method.

### Continued development

I would like to continue focusing on HTML/CSS/JS in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This is my favorite resource site for html and css syntax.  
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41468951/images-not-displaying-in-github-pages) - This post helped me figure out why my images weren't loading from GitHub Pages.  It turns out that I was using a relative path, but starting the URL with "./" instead of just "/" resolved the issue.
